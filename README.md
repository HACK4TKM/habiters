The Problem


When I was a kid, I thought If you get cancer, it means you're dead. One of the deadliest diseases, and morethan 10 million people die from cancer Every year. But what if there is a way to catch cancer before it spreads in our body using your breath only, and that's what our team is building on.


The Solution


Anyone could have cancer in their body, and they wouldn't even know it.
because there are no symptoms. So we instead of trying to find cancer after it spreads why not catch it before it spreads? I have read Hippocrates has used his nose in order to smell many types of disease. From his breath, he learned that diseases can change the smell of your breath In fact, dogs can detect cancer and other diseases. Disease just by smelling a person's urine and breath sample, So we are building a device that works just like a dog's nose. This is the N-AI-NOS device. Here is how it works in our body when a cancer cell grows, it releases tiny molecules that try to escape your body These molecules travel to the lungs. Where they mix with the air in our lungs. release, so if you have a cancer cell Growing inside your body, the air you breather elease will have these cancer molecules.and that's where N-AI-NOS come in.
When you exhale into the N-AI-NOS, the device will study the breath using Nanotechnology and AI and try to look for molecules.those tiny cancer molecules and if it catches them, it will signal and alert And that's how this machine can tell if you have cancer or not even before any of the symptoms show just based on your breath.
